    "### *The Data*\n",
    "1. [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Personal fitness tracker data collected from 30 consenting fitbit users in 2016. It includes minute level output for exercise, heart rate and daily activity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Source:** External 3^rd^ party data.\n",
    "* **Type:** Structured continuous & discrete mostly nominal quantitative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Problems\n",
    "* The Fitbit data used was collected from only 30 users. This is a very small sample size when considering that there are around 30 million users. Our sample size therefore represents roughly 1 millionth or 0.0001% of the population.\n",
    "* In addition to the above, the data was collected in 2016 so it is outdated. Were this study carried out a year ago during a pandemic and lockdowns, the data might even be misleading as people's exercise and eating habits are likely not the same during a pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to identify what the major problems are, explain how you have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support your findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Solutions\n",
    "Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Don’t forget to include pros and cons for each solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "End your presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Next steps\n",
    "Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will a ect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when.\n",
