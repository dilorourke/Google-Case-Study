## Introduction
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at [Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/), a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

### *The purpose of this project;*
Is to use data to gain insights into customer usage of the company’s products and identify new growth opportunities for the company.  
An analysis of smart device usage could identify new and unseen trends which could be investigated further to explore if they can be applied to Bellabeat customers. Applying these trends and behaviours to the company’s marketing strategy could improve future sales revenue.
